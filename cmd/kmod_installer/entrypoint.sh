    #           We canâ€™t pin to a specific driver version because GKE nodes can skew from the control plane version. 
    #           If we pin to a fixed version and the control plane is ahead of the node, it could result in a kmod installer failure due to the node's kernel being too old for the specified driver version.
    # --kernelmodulestree: Sets the path to the kernel modules directory on the host ('/host_modules').
    # --lsb-release-path: Specifies the path to the lsb-release file on the host ('/host_etc/lsb-release').
    # --insert-on-install: Inserts the module into the kernel after installation.
